# INTRODUCTION
Cat Digital uses telematics data collected from customers’ equipment to proactively detect 
potential present or future equipment failures. In this project we have developed an AI 
solution that reproduces and possibly surpasses a human expert’s thought processes in 
predicting equipment failures using telematics data .

# PROJECT ABSTRACT
Using the telematics data collected, the model predicts when the threshold value of a 
particular event will occur for a given candidate and alerts the customer beforehand. As a 
future development, we have also planned to incorporate certain features such as a mail 
to the customer 3-5 days before warning about the system failure. Also, a stock checking 
in the nearest store so that the customer can easily replace or repair the faulted equipment.
